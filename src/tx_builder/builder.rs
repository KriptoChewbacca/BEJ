//! Core TransactionBuilder implementation
//!
//! This module contains the main TxBuilder struct that orchestrates all
//! transaction building operations by composing the context, instructions,
//! simulation, and output modules.
//!
//! ## Responsibilities
//! - Coordinate between NonceManager, RpcManager, and WalletManager
//! - Orchestrate the transaction building pipeline
//! - Apply transaction configuration and policies
//! - Handle both durable nonce and recent blockhash modes
//!
//! ## Implementation Status
//! **TODO (Task 6)**: Implement full TxBuilder struct and methods

// Placeholder for TxBuilder implementation
// This will be implemented in Task 6

#[allow(dead_code)]
pub struct TxBuilder {
    // Fields will be added in Task 6
}

#[allow(dead_code)]
impl TxBuilder {
    // Methods will be added in Task 6
}
