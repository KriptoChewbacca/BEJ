# NOTE: Nightly is required due to transitive dependencies requiring edition2024
# Specifically: base64ct 1.8.0+ (pulled by cryptography crates) requires edition2024
# which is only available in nightly as of Rust 1.83.
#
# This is a temporary requirement until:
# 1. Rust 1.85+ stabilizes edition2024 (expected early 2025), OR
# 2. Dependencies update to support stable Rust without edition2024
#
# We do NOT use any nightly-specific features in our code - all code is edition2021 compatible.
# See MSRV.md for detailed explanation.
